Hi! This is a project I started a while ago when all the SSL pwns were happening, but I have school and must study therefore I have little time to manage this anymore, so I put it here for the world to work with. It's (currently) written in PHP for god knows what reason, but it should possibly redeveloped in JavaScript. I'll be trying to make some progress tonight but not sure where I'll get.

Thanks,
